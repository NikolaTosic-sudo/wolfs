            <h1>WOLFS</h1>
            <p>Wolfs are my favorite animals, so I wanted to make this site just for them.</p>
            <p>The wolf (Canis lupus), also known as the gray/grey wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 35.5–37.7 kg (78–83 lb). It is also distinguished from other Canis species by its less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy and predominantly a mottled gray colour, although nearly pure white, red and brown to black also occur. Mammal Species of the World (3rd ed., 2005), a standard reference work in zoology, recognizes 38 subspecies of C. lupus.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 p-5 textsec">The English 'wolf' stems from the Old English wulf, which is itself thought to be derived from the Proto-Germanic *wulfaz. The Latin lupus is a Sabine loanword. Both derive from the Proto-Indo-European root *wĺ̥kʷos or *lúkʷos. Old English literature contains several instances of Anglo-Saxon kings and warriors taking on wulf as a prefix or suffix in their names. Examples include Wulfhere ("Wolf Army"), Cynewulf ("Royal Wolf"), Cēnwulf ("Bold Wolf"), Wulfheard ("Wolf-hard"), Earnwulf ("Eagle Wolf"), Wulfstān ("Wolf Stone") and Æðelwulf ("Noble Wolf"). Wolf-related names were also common among pre-Christian Germanic warriors: Wolfhroc (Wolf-Frock), Wolfhetan (Wolf Hide), Isangrim (Gray Mask), Scrutolf (Garb Wolf), Wolfgang (Wolf Gait) and Wolfdregil (Wolf Runner).
                Colloquial names were applied to wolves in the United States. The name "gray wolf" is the most commonly used and refers to the grayish colour of the larger wolves, "red wolf" to the wolf of the south east, "brown wolf" to the now extinct wolf of western Oregon and Washington, and "buffalo wolf" to the now extinct wolf of the Great Plains region</div>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 animleft" id="evo"><img src="./images/wolfevol.jfif" alt="ety" class="secimg"></div>
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 px-5 pt-5 pt-lg-0 textsec">The earliest fossils of C. lupus were found in what was once eastern Beringia at Old Crow, Yukon, Canada, and at Cripple Creek Sump, Fairbanks, Alaska. The age is not agreed upon but could date 1 million YBP. Considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves by the Late Pleistocene. Compared with modern wolves, some Pleistocene wolves showed an increase in tooth breakage that is similar to that seen in the extinct dire wolf. This suggests that they either often processed carcasses, or that they competed with other carnivores and needed to quickly consume their prey. This continuous wolf presence contrasts with genomic studies which suggest that all modern wolves and dogs descend from a common ancestral wolf population that existed as recently as 20,000 years ago. This implies that the original morphologically diverse wolf populations were out-competed and replaced by modern-like wolves.</div>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 px-5 py-4 textsec">Although social animals, single wolves or mated pairs typically have higher success rates in hunting than do large packs, with single wolves having occasionally been observed to kill large prey such as moose, bison and muskoxen unaided. This contrasts with the common-held belief that larger packs benefit from cooperative hunting in order to bring down large game. The size of a wolf hunting pack is related to the number of pups that survived the previous winter, adult survival, and the rate of dispersing wolves leaving the pack. The optimal pack size for hunting elk is four wolves, and for bison a large pack size is more successful.</div>

            <div class="col-lg-6 col-12 px-5 pt-5 pt-lg-0 textsec">The wolf is a common motif in the mythologies and cosmologies of peoples throughout its historical range. The Ancient Greeks associated wolves with Apollo, the god of light and order. The Ancient Romans connected the wolf with their god of war and agriculture Mars, and believed their founders Romulus and Remus were suckled by a she-wolf. Norse mythology includes the feared giant wolf Fenrir, eldest child of Loki and Angrboda, and Geri and Freki, Odin's faithful pets. In the Pawnee creation myth, the wolf was the first animal brought to earth and when humans killed it, they were punished with death, destruction and the loss of immortality. For the Pawnee, Sirius was the "wolf star" and its disappearance and reappearance signified the wolf moving to and from the spirit world. Both the Pawnee and Blackfoot called the Milky Way the "wolf trail". In Chinese astronomy, the wolf represents Sirius as the "blue beast" and the star itself is called the "heavenly wolf". <br>Aesop featured wolves in several of his fables, playing on the concerns of Ancient Greece's settled, sheep-herding world. His most famous is the fable of "The Boy Who Cried Wolf". Some of his other fables concentrate on maintaining the trust between shepherds and guard dogs in their vigilance against wolves, as well as anxieties over the close relationship between wolves and dogs. Although Aesop used wolves to warn, criticize and moralize about human behaviour, his portrayals added to the wolf's image as a deceitful and dangerous animal. The Bible contains 13 references to wolves, usually as metaphors for greed and destructiveness. In the New Testament, Jesus is quoted to have used wolves as illustrations to the dangers his followers, whom he represents as sheep, would face should they follow him.

                <p class="pt-3">In Canada, 50,000–60,000 wolves live on 80% of their historical range, which makes Canada an important stronghold for the species. Under Canadian law First Nations people can hunt wolves without restrictions but other citizens must acquire licenses for the hunting and trapping seasons. As many as 4,000 wolves may be harvested in Canada each year. The wolf is a protected species in national parks under the Canada National Parks Act.</p>

                <p class="pt-3">Europe, excluding Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, has 17,000 wolves in over 28 countries. Wolves have been persecuted in Europe for centuries, having been exterminated in the British Isles in the 18th century, in Central Europe by 1899, in France by the 1930s, and in much of Scandinavia by the early 1970s. However, they continued to survive in parts of Finland, Southern Europe, and Eastern Europe. Since 1980, European wolves have rebounded and expanded into parts of their former range.</p>

                <p class="pt-3">In the Middle East, only Israel and Oman give wolves explicit legal protection. Turkey has a estimated population of about 7,000 wolves. In the remainder of the Middle East region, the wolf populations may number 1,000-2,000. Israel has protected their wolves since 1954 and has maintained a moderately-sized population of 150 though effective enforcement of conservation policies. These wolves have moved into neighboring countries. Approximately 300–600 wolves inhabit the Arabian Peninsula. In addition, the wolf appears to be widespread in Iran.</p>
